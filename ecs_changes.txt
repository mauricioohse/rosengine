Based on the code shown, here's a step-by-step plan to improve the component system while maintaining the C-style approach and compatibility with the current system:
Phase 1: Component Registration System
Create a component registry system that handles component type registration at startup
Move component type definitions to a central location
Create macros for component registration that automatically:
Generate component type IDs
Register component size
Register component name
Register init/destroy functions
Phase 2: Component Array Management
Create a generic component pool structure that can:
Store any component type
Handle component allocation/deallocation
Track active components
Create a component pool manager that:
Creates pools for registered components
Handles component access
Manages memory for components
Phase 3: Improved Component Access
Create type-safe component access macros
Add component dependency tracking
Add component relationship tracking
Improve error handling and validation
Phase 4: Component Creation Helpers
Create a component builder pattern that:
Provides a fluent interface for component initialization
Handles component dependencies
Validates component data
Create component templates system
Add component serialization support
Phase 5: System Improvements
Add system dependencies
Add system ordering
Create system groups
Add system enable/disable support
